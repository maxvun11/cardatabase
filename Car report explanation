Car data report includes a detailed analysis of the car dataset, oriented towards cars of a certain year, 
those whose selling prices are in a certain range, and the average selling prices of cars in different years. 
There are three major divisions to the report.

The first section in this report includes all cars produced in the year 2010. 
Given information for each car pertains to the name of the car, manufacturing year, selling price, 
current market price, kilometers driven, fuel type, type of seller, transmission type, and the number of previous owners. 
This enables one to see the characteristics and market trend analysis for cars manufactured in the year 2010.

The second section gives all cars whose selling price is more than a certain threshold, 20 in this case.
Details about each car are given here, just as in the first section. 
This section helps to list higher valued cars and analyze their attributes against the rest of the dataset.

The third section contains the average selling price of cars year by year from 2012 to 2020. 
It provides a brief insight into the average market trends for those years and may be helpful for market analysis, 
investment insight, or historical trends. In this respect, the report details each year either by the average selling price 
or, alternatively, that there is no data, thereby providing for a yearly comparison and insight into pricing trends.
